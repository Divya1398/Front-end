      <p>Responsive design ensures that web content adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. By employing flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries, designers can create interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing across devices.</p>
      <p>Implementing responsive typography is a key aspect of this approach. Utilizing relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>, along with media queries, allows text to scale appropriately, enhancing readability. Additionally, selecting appropriate font families contributes to the overall user experience.</p>
      <p>Embracing responsive design principles not only improves accessibility but also future-proofs websites against the ever-evolving landscape of devices and screen resolutions.</p>
